  <p>  HorseBnB was created by horse owners for horse owners and horse enthusiasts. The goal of HorseBnB is to simplify all aspects of horse ownership. We have seen the need for a platform of this type for a long time. After years and years of being on the road with our horses, we realized there has to be a better way to connect horse people with other horse people.
  </p>
  <p> HorseBnB is the first platform that allows everyone in the horse world to easily connect with one another. We at HorseBnB want everyone who has a horse or a barn to have this App on their phone. We provide solutions for long term board, short term stays, and horse activities. This is just the beginning for HorseBnB. We have great plans of expanding HorseBnB to simplify all other aspects of horse ownership in the future.</p>

   HorseBnB all starts with the horse community and we canâ€™t build an online horse community without YOU! If you love the HorseBnB website and App, spread the word to your fellow horse friends and horse family members. The more users HorseBnB has, the bigger and better the community will be.
